### 11. Go to [Oauth Consent Screen] and click [Publish App] to publish this to production.

a. If you upload App logo in the fourth step, you need Click [Prepare for verification] and fill the missing information.

b. Google will email you and you will have to reply to start the process. You'll need to have your domain verified with Google Search Console. You can go ahead and do that now.

c. You can already login with Google on localhost. On production, it will work too but show a warning until you're verified (takes a few days).

d. If you don't upload App logo in the fourth step, your app will be ready to use immediately! (recommend this!)
